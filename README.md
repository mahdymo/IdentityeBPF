# eBPF Code Examples

Welcome to the eBPF Code Examples repository! This repository contains example code demonstrating the power and versatility of eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) in enhancing security and identity enforcement in IoT and distributed systems.

## Overview

With the widespread adoption of IoT devices and the distributed nature of modern tooling, ensuring robust security across diverse environments is crucial. eBPF offers a simple yet powerful approach to address these challenges, allowing for real-time packet filtering, monitoring, and manipulation within the Linux kernel.

While many of the explored eBPF use cases focus on filtering and application security, this repository highlights the potential of eBPF in the Identity space. By seamlessly processing traffic, capturing authentication requests, and enhancing identity enforcement, eBPF opens new possibilities for securing IoT and distributed systems.

## Contents

This repository contains the following eBPF code examples:

1. **HTTP Traffic Redirection**: Demonstrates how to intercept and redirect HTTP traffic to an authentication server for identity verification using eBPF.

   - [http_redirect.c](http_redirect.c): C code implementing the eBPF program for HTTP traffic redirection.
   - [http_redirect.py](http_redirect.py): Python script for loading and attaching the eBPF program to the network stack.

## Getting Started

To run the eBPF code examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a compatible Linux environment with BPF support enabled.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IdentityeBPF.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the directory containing the desired example code.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the README file within each example directory to build, load, and run the eBPF program.
